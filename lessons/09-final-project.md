# Lesson 9: Final Project — Build a Complete Game! 🎮🏆

## Goal

Put ALL your Python skills to the test! You'll build a complete project that uses everything you've learned: variables, input, f-strings, types, random numbers, if/elif/else, and while loops.

## 🎯 What You'll Practice

- **Variables** and **f-strings** (Lessons 1-3)
- **Type conversion** with `int()` (Lesson 4)
- **Random numbers** with `random.randint()` (Lesson 5)
- **If/elif/else** logic and `and`/`or` (Lessons 6-7)
- **While loops** and `break` (Lesson 8)

## 🌟 Main Project: The Cosmic Cafe 🚀🍔

You are the manager of "The Cosmic Cafe," the busiest restaurant in the galaxy! Build a smart ordering system that takes orders, applies deals, and calculates prices.

We'll build this step-by-step. Complete each part before moving to the next!

---

### Part 1: Taking the Main Order (Easy)

**Your Task:**
1. Welcome the customer
2. Display a numbered menu
3. Ask for their choice using `int(input())`
4. Confirm their order with `if`/`elif`/`else`

```python
print("🚀 Welcome to the Cosmic Cafe! 🚀")
print()
print("=== MAIN MENU ===")
print("1) Meteor Burger - 10 credits")
print("2) Galaxy Pizza - 12 credits")
print("3) Black Hole Bagel - 8 credits")

main_choice = int(input("Choose a main (1/2/3): "))

if main_choice == 1:
    print("One Meteor Burger coming up!")
elif main_choice == 2:
    print("One Galaxy Pizza coming up!")
elif main_choice == 3:
    print("One Black Hole Bagel coming up!")
else:
    print("Sorry, that's not on the menu!")
```

---

### Part 2: Adding Prices and Sides (Medium)

**Your Task:**
1. Create `total_cost = 0`
2. Add the main dish price to `total_cost`
3. Ask for a side dish
4. Add the side price to `total_cost`
5. Print the subtotal

```python
total_cost = 0

# Add main dish price
if main_choice == 1:
    total_cost += 10    # Burger
elif main_choice == 2:
    total_cost += 12    # Pizza
elif main_choice == 3:
    total_cost += 8     # Bagel

print()
print("=== SIDES ===")
print("0) No side")
print("1) Asteroid Fries - 3 credits")
print("2) Saturn Rings - 4 credits")

side_choice = int(input("Choose a side (0/1/2): "))

if side_choice == 1:
    total_cost += 3
elif side_choice == 2:
    total_cost += 4

print(f"Subtotal: {total_cost} credits")
```

---

### Part 3: Combo Deals! (Hard)

Now add special deals using `and` and `or`:

**Deals:**
- Burger + Fries combo: Save 2 credits
- (Pizza OR Bagel) + any side: Save 1 credit

```python
# Burger + Fries combo
if main_choice == 1 and side_choice == 1:
    print("🎉 Burger + Fries combo! -2 credits")
    total_cost -= 2

# Pizza or Bagel with any side
if (main_choice == 2 or main_choice == 3) and (side_choice != 0):
    print("🎉 Meal deal! -1 credit")
    total_cost -= 1

print(f"After deals: {total_cost} credits")
```

**Note the parentheses!** They make the logic clear:
- `(main_choice == 2 or main_choice == 3)` — Pizza OR Bagel
- `(side_choice != 0)` — They ordered a side

---

### Part 4: Planetary Delivery (Challenge)

Add delivery fees with nested `if` statements:

```python
print()
print("=== DELIVERY ===")
print("1) Mars - 5 credits")
print("2) Venus - 7 credits")
print("3) Jupiter - varies")
print("0) Pickup (free)")

planet = int(input("Delivery destination (0/1/2/3): "))

if planet == 1:
    total_cost += 5
    print("Delivering to Mars!")
elif planet == 2:
    total_cost += 7
    print("Delivering to Venus!")
elif planet == 3:
    is_tuesday = int(input("Is today Tuesday? (1=yes, 2=no): "))
    if is_tuesday == 1:
        print("🎉 Free Jupiter delivery on Tuesdays!")
    else:
        total_cost += 10
        print("Jupiter delivery: 10 credits")
elif planet == 0:
    print("Pickup selected - no delivery fee!")

print()
print("=" * 30)
print(f"💫 TOTAL: {total_cost} credits 💫")
print("=" * 30)
```

### Test Your Cosmic Cafe

Try these orders and check your totals:

| Main | Side | Planet | Tuesday? | Expected Total |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | -------- | -------------- |
| 1 (Burger) | 1 (Fries) | 1 (Mars) | - | 16 |
| 2 (Pizza) | 2 (Rings) | 2 (Venus) | - | 22 |
| 3 (Bagel) | 0 (none) | 0 (Pickup) | - | 8 |
| 3 (Bagel) | 1 (Fries) | 3 (Jupiter) | 1 (yes) | 10 |
| 2 (Pizza) | 0 (none) | 3 (Jupiter) | 2 (no) | 22 |

### Project 2: Rock Paper Scissors Tournament

Build a best-of-5 game against the computer:
- Computer chooses randomly
- Track wins, losses, ties
- Play until someone wins 3 games
- Ask if they want to play again

### Project 3: Number Guessing Game (Enhanced)

- Let the player choose the difficulty (1-10, 1-50, or 1-100)
- Give hints like "very hot" or "cold" based on how close they are
- Track their best score across multiple games

### Project 4: Interactive Story Adventure

## What's Next?

Here are some ideas to keep learning:
- **Lists** — Store multiple items in one variable
- **For loops** — A different way to repeat code
- **Functions** — Reusable blocks of code
- **Files** — Save and load data

Keep coding and have fun! 🐍✨
