# Lesson 5: Practice Problems üß†üí™

## Goal
Put all your Python skills to the test! These 10 problems will help you practice everything you've learned so far and think like a real programmer.

## üéØ What You'll Practice
- **Variables** and **f-strings** (from Assignment 1)
- **`int()`**, **comparison operators**, and **`if`/`else`** (from Assignment 2)  
- **`while` loops** and **`!=`** (from Assignment 3)

## Problem 1: The Age Calculator üìÖ

Ask the user for their birth year and calculate how old they are (or will be) in 2025. Then tell them what life stage they're in:
- 0-12: "You're a kid!"
- 13-19: "You're a teenager!"
- 20-64: "You're an adult!"
- 65+: "You're a senior!"

**Bonus:** Add their age in dog years (multiply by 7)!

## Problem 2: The Persistent Survey üìä

Create a survey that asks "How was your day? (good/bad/okay)" and keeps asking until they give one of those three answers. Then respond appropriately with a response depending on their answer (should be different of each answer).

**What you'll need:**
- A `while` loop that continues while their answer is not one of the valid options
- `if`/`elif`/`else` to respond to their final answer

## Problem 3: The Shopping Cart Calculator üõí

Create a shopping program that:
1. Asks for item names and prices until the user types "done"
2. Calculates the total cost
3. Shows the final total

**What you'll need:**
- A `while` loop to keep adding items
- Variables to track total cost

---

## Problem 4: The Grade Calculator üìö

Ask the user for test scores until they type "done", then calculate their average and give them a letter grade:
- 90-100: A
- 80-89: B  
- 70-79: C
- 60-69: D
- Below 60: F

**Challenge:** Also tell them how many points they need to reach the next letter grade!

## Problem 5: The Story Adventure üìñ

Create an interactive story where the user makes choices that affect the outcome. Use `if`/`else` statements to create different paths through your story.

**Example structure:**
```
You find a mysterious door. Do you (open/ignore) it?
> open
The door creaks open. Inside you see (describe what you see).
Do you (enter/run) ?
> enter
(Continue the story based on their choice...)
```

Make at least 3 decision points with different outcomes!

## Problem 6: The Multiplication Trainer üßÆ

Create a math practice program that:
1. Asks what multiplication table they want to practice (1-12)
2. Gives them 5 random problems from that table using the random library
3. Keeps track of how many they get right
4. Shows their final score

**What you'll need:**
- A loop to ask 5 questions and break when done
- Variables to track correct answers
- `if` statements to check if they're right

## Problem 7: The Ultimate Challenge - Rock Paper Scissors Tournament üèÜ

Create a Rock Paper Scissors game that:
1. Plays against the computer (computer chooses randomly)
2. Keeps track of wins, losses, and ties
3. Plays until someone wins 3 games (best of 5)
4. Asks if they want to play again when done

**What you'll need:**
- `while` loops for the game and tournament
- `if`/`elif`/`else` for game logic
- Variables to track scores
- Input validation to make sure they enter valid choices
