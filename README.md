# Learn Python 🐍

Fun, hands-on Python lessons designed to help a child learn to code step-by-step. Each lesson introduces a small set of concepts with playful examples and a mini project. Short practice tasks help reinforce learning.

## Who This Is For
- Beginners and kids (no prior coding experience required)
- Parents/teachers mentoring a young learner

## Getting Started
1. **Start with Lesson 0** to set up VS Code on your computer
2. Work through lessons 1–9 in order
3. Read the explanations and run the example code
4. Try the homework/challenges at the end of each lesson

## Lesson Overview

### 🛠️ Setup
- [Lesson 0: VS Code Setup](lessons/00-vscode-setup.md)
  - Install VS Code and Python, create your first file, and learn to run code.

### 📦 Module 1: The Basics (Output & Memory)
- [Lesson 1: Hello World — Printing](lessons/01-printing.md)
  - Learn `print()` to display text and numbers. Understand strings vs numbers.

- [Lesson 2: Variables — Memory Boxes](lessons/02-variables.md)
  - Store information in variables, change values, and use meaningful names.

- [Lesson 3: Input and F-strings](lessons/03-input-and-fstrings.md)
  - Get user input with `input()` and build beautiful messages with f-strings.

### 🧠 Module 2: The Logic (Making Decisions)
- [Lesson 4: Types and Casting](lessons/04-types-and-casting.md)
  - Understand why `"5"` and `5` are different. Convert between text and numbers with `int()`, `float()`, and `str()`.

- [Lesson 5: Random Numbers](lessons/05-random-numbers.md)
  - Use `import random` and `random.randint()` to add unpredictability to your programs.

- [Lesson 6: If/Else Logic](lessons/06-if-else-logic.md)
  - Make decisions with `if`/`elif`/`else` and comparison operators. Learn why indentation matters!

- [Lesson 7: Complex Logic](lessons/07-complex-logic.md)
  - Combine conditions with `and`/`or`/`not`, use nested `if` statements, and chain comparisons.

### 🔄 Module 3: Flow Control (Repetition)
- [Lesson 8: While Loops](lessons/08-while-loops.md)
  - Repeat code with `while` loops, use `break` to exit early, and avoid infinite loops.

### 🏆 Module 4: The Project
- [Lesson 9: Final Project — The Cosmic Cafe](lessons/09-final-project.md)
  - Build a complete ordering system! Combines everything: variables, input, logic, and loops.
