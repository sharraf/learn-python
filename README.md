# Learn Python for Kids

Fun, hands-on Python lessons designed to help a child learn to code step-by-step. Each lesson introduces a small set of concepts with playful examples and a mini project. Short practice tasks help reinforce learning.

## Who this is for
- Beginners and kids (no prior coding experience required)
- Parents/teachers mentoring a young learner

## How to use
1. Open each lesson in order (1â€“9)
2. Read the explanations and run the example code
3. Try the homework/challenges at the end of each lesson

## Lessons
- [Lesson 1: The Mad Libs Story Generator](lessons/1-print-input.md)
  - Learn `print()`, `input()`, variables, and f-strings by building a funny story.

- [Lesson 2: Movie Ticket Bot](lessons/2-if-else.md)
  - Introduces `int()`, comparison operators, and `if`/`elif`/`else` to make decisions.

- [Lesson 3: The Secret Password](lessons/3-while-loops.md)
  - Practice `while` loops, the `!=` operator, and `break` to repeat actions until a goal is met.

- [Lesson 4: The Lucky Number Generator](lessons/4-import-random.md)
  - Use `import random` and `random.randint()` to create games and random events.

- [Lesson 5: Practice Problems](lessons/5-practice.md)
  - A set of practice challenges combining input, conditions, and loops.

- [Lesson 6: Variables and Assignment](lessons/6-variable-assignment.md)
  - Store inputs in variables, convert numbers, and update values with +=/-= and f-strings.

- [Lesson 7: Say It Nicely with f-Strings](lessons/7-f-strings.md)
  - Preferred way to build messages: put variables and math inside `{}`; avoid using `+` to glue strings.

- [Lesson 8: If Power-Ups](lessons/8-advanced-if-branching.md)
  - Go beyond basics with `and`/`or`/`not`, nested `if`, order of checks, and chained comparisons.

- [Lesson 9: The Great Cosmic Cafe Project](lessons/9-if-branching-problem.md)
  - Build a full interactive ordering system using complex branching and combined conditions.
